# Hydra Reduction Pipeline
The pipeline is currently in active development. This Python-based pipeline is designed to reduce Hydra data automatically, accounting for fiber position variations by deriving fiber positions and wavelength solutions on-the-fly for each dataset. The pipeline takes raw data from Hydra and produces a 1-D spectrum for each target.

For a brief description of how to run the pipeline, visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/richardseifert/Hydra_pipeline/wiki/How-to-Run)
